# Waveshare EPaper demo for Espressif IoT Development Framework

This project converts some of the demo files from [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com)'s sample code to build cleanly under ESP IDF without requiring the Arduino component.

Currently only these devics are converted:
* 13in3k
* 1in54v2

Please consider submitting PR's for other sizes.  See the above as references for the structure of components and include paths.
